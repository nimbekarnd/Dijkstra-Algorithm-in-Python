# Dijkstra Algorithm in Python 
This is the implementation of dijkstra algorithm for ground robots. This is our implementation of Project 2 as part of the course ENPM661 to understand how the dijkstra algorithm works and visualize it using OpenCV.


## Dependencies
This code was tested with the following dependencies:
- Python 3
- Opencv 3.4.5
- Numpy
