# Dijkstra Algorithm in Python 
This is the implementation of dijkstra algorithm for ground robots. This is our implementation of Project 2 as part of the course ENPM661 to understand how the dijkstra algorithm works and visualize it using OpenCV.


## Dependencies
This code was tested with the following dependencies:
- Python 3
- Opencv 3.4.5
- Numpy

## Instructions

The directory has two python files 'dij.py' and 'dijkstratrial.py'. The second file consists of the code written for algorithm and viualization.

You will have to run dij.py and give start and end points along with the radius of robot and clearance value. When the radius is 0, the code will act on a point robot.
